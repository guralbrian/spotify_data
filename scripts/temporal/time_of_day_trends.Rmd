```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load libs, results = 'hide', include=F}
libs <- c("tidyverse", "gplots", "viridis", "factoextra", "shiny", "DT", "magrittr", "dplyr")
lapply(libs, require, character.only = T)
```

```{r load data, include=F}
#lis.df <- read.csv("data/list_attr/bg_1y_t100.csv") # for non-shiny paths
lis.df <- read.csv("data/list_attr/bg_1y_t500.csv")
def.attr <- read.csv("attribute_definitions.csv")
temp.df <- read.csv("data/raw/listen_history_1year.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
